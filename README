ZendA - is ZendAddons library which completes missing Zend Framework functionality.

v. 0.3.0

== Instaliation ==

Put code to library folder. In your application.ini file add: autoloaderNamespaces[] = "ZendA" & in your Bootstrap.php file: $view->addHelperPath('ZendA/View/Helper/', 'ZendA_View_Helper');

== Tests ==

To run tests you must add Zend directory. I do this by adding symbolic link for example: ln -s /Users/user/Sites/htdocs/Zend/Current/ Zendr
